  <summary>👨🏻‍💻My Coding Journey</summary>
  I have always been interested in computers and technology ever since I was a kid. I've always wanted to be a programmer and build applications, but my coding journey started in college. During my first year there, I began learning C++, but I never finished it. At the time, I wanted to see the results of my code quickly and visually, which led to my interest in web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was very fun and amazing to create headers, footers, and all sorts of visual elements. However, the visual and graphical components that could be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript weren't enough for me; I wanted to develop the logic of these applications too. So I started learning Node.js, and now I'm here, passionate about developing and eager to learn more about programming.
